*Take CVS as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision*

---
*For the first 10 years of kernel maintenance, we literally used tarballs and patches, which is a much superior source control management system than CVS is.*

---
*Subversion has been the most pointless project ever started... Subversion used to say, 'CVS done right.' With that slogan there is nowhere you can go. There is no way to do CVS right."*

---
*If you like using CVS, you should be in some kind of mental institution or somewhere else.*
